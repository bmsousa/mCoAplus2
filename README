mCoA2++ additions for OMNEST/OMNeT++ 4.0
=======================================
further info: http://mcoa.dei.uc.pt

This version has been implemented on INETMANET.
The need to haev support for multiple interfaces on a
single node has justified INETMANET.

The First version of mCoA++ will not be supported, sorry
about this.
